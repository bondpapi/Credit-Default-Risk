# Home Credit Default Risk Prediction

## Overview

This project builds a robust machine learning pipeline to predict the likelihood of a client defaulting on a loan using the **Home Credit Default Risk** dataset. It applies end-to-end steps from data exploration, statistical inference, and model tuning to deployment via a FastAPI REST service.

## Data Sources

- `application_train.csv` 

- `application_test.csv` 

- `bureau.csv`, `bureau_balance.csv`

## Goal

To build a predictive model that estimates the risk of loan default at the time of application, aiding financial institutions in credit decision-making.

## Workflow Summary

### Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering
- Merged external tables using `SK_ID_CURR` 

- Aggregated temporal and categorical behavior features 

- Applied missing value strategies: dropping, median imputation, or KNN where relevant 

- Categorical encoding with one-hot and domain logic

### EDA & Statistical Inference
- Explored key distributions, outliers, and correlations 

- Applied hypothesis tests to validate risk-related assumptions

### Modeling
- Tuned base models:
  - Logistic Regression 

  - Random Forest 

  - XGBoost 

- Applied SMOTE / class weighting to address imbalance 

- Stacked ensemble using XGBoost as meta-learner 

- Trained a deep neural network (`dnn_model.h5`) with:
  - Batch Normalization 

  - Dropout regularization 

  - Early stopping

### Threshold Optimization
- Evaluated model thresholds using:
  - **F1-score** maximization 

  - **Youdenâ€™s J** index 

- Selected optimal thresholds to balance recall and precision in imbalanced settings

### Deployment
- Exported models & preprocessing pipeline using `joblib` and `Keras` 

- Deployed via **FastAPI** 

- Dockerized for production readiness (GCP compatible)
